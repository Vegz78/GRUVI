# GRUVI 
### (.generate.random.URLs_for.viewing.images.)
Image file URL list generator for displaying a list of image files on a web server or for screensaver/slideshow of random images via the Image Viewer app(photo frame) on the Squeezebox/Logitech/Lyrion Touch, Radio etc. 

![alt text](https://github.com/Vegz78/GRUVI/blob/master/Images/Play.gif)

gruvi.php functions as a command line tool to fairly quickly produce lists of file
paths or URL-links to images from a selection of folders and their subfolders
Or to convert the images in similar folder selections to copies in the default
gruvi_img folder in the working directory of the script, with corresponding lists
of file paths or URL-links (LMS default) to these copies.

gruvi.php should work on any webserver with PHP support and when called directly from either
any web browser or any LMS player with a screen to display images. gruvi.php identifies the
SB Radio or Touch players automatically based on the HTTP_USER_AGENT provided by the
Image Viewer application and adjusts the corresponding image dimensions accordingly to show
correctly on their screens. Additional adjustments to settings in the gruvi.php script files
itself can be made to accomodate other players and screen sizes.<br><br>

## Features
* Flexibile command line tool or web sever hosted script with many options in the settings in the gruvi.php script itself or through command line or URL arguments
* Random or ordered selection of files and with choice of random shuffling of the lists with links to image files between every call to gruvi.php on independent web servers, or with periodic scheduled jobs
* Make locally cached copies of the images with reduced sizes or link directly to the original image files
* Make links to the image files as URL addresses or as file paths
* Image files hosted on a web server of your chosing and copies fittet to custom (screen) sizes
* Choice between images with or without capitons generated by file and folder names
* Choice of number of cached files and expiry time for reload of new batches of images
* Support for multiple image folders with internal distribution weighing for the random image selection
* Choice between serial and parallel processing of the ImageMagick conversions of image folders
* Make lists of preset sizes or choose instead to scan all images in your selected folders and make links to all images found
* Informative console output of job settings and practical DRYRUN argument to test your chosen settings before execution
* Extensive command line help screen called with the arguments -h, --help, /? or HELP
* Support for bmp, cr2, gif, heic, jpeg, png, tiff and webp image source files
* Runs on Windows, Linux and MacOS

If used together with the Lyrion Music Server: Choice between total independence from LMS on any web server, or to run on the LMS internal web server.

                                            settings set inside the gruvi.php script file

```
IN WEB BROWSERS / THE SB PLAYER'S IMAGE VIEWER SOURCE SPECIFIC SETTINGS:
```plaintext
(replace with webserver's true IP address and root folder):
http://192.168.x.y/gruvi.php               -Produces image list directly with images for the
                                            SB Radio with settings set inside the gruvi.php
                                            script file
http://192.168.x.y/gruvi.php?player=Touch  -Produces image list directly with images for the
                                            SB Touch with settings set inside the gruvi.php
http://192.168.x.y/gruvi.php?player=Custom -Produces image list directly with images for a
                                            custom player, e.g. the O2 Joggler 800x480, with
                                            custom settings inside the gruvi.php script file

For the Lyrion/Logitech/Squeezebox Music Server's built in webserver
(replace with the LMS' true IP address):
http://192.168.x.y:9000/html/sbradio.txt   -Image list directly to images for the SB Radio
                                            with settings set inside the gruvi.php script
http://192.168.x.y:9000/html/sbtouch.txt   -Image list directly for the Touch or a custom
http://192.168.x.y:9000/html/gruvi.txt      player with settings inside the gruvi.php script

Since the LMS internal webserver does not support PHP, the images pointed to in the lists
must be produced by a scheduled task on the computer running LMS.
```
Feel free to copy, modify and use as you want. The script does what it's supposed to on my home system and won't be very actively supported, updated or maintained.

## Prerequisites
* PHP version 5 or newer
* ImageMagick version 6 or 7
* Some webserver with access to the photos you want to show<br>
(Now GRUVI supports running on the LMS's internal web server)

## Installation

### Installation as an independen command line tool
1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/Vegz78/GRUVI/releases) or `git clone https://github.com/Vegz78/GRUVI`
2. If applicable, make gruvi.php executable: `(sudo) chmod 755 gruvi.php`
3. Store gruvi.php or a link to gruvi.php inside one of your $PATH folders

### Installation on a web server
1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/Vegz78/GRUVI/releases) or `git clone https://github.com/Vegz78/GRUVI` into the folder you want gruvi.php hosted from on the web server
2. Set the global variables to suit your needs in the main gruvi.php script file ([See the settings here](https://github.com/Vegz78/GRUVI/blob/e868137d82cc94311c95683ac2bd404641717f65/gruvi.php#L40))<br>
  (Make sure that the global [$URL_ROOT setting](https://github.com/Vegz78/GRUVI/blob/e868137d82cc94311c95683ac2bd404641717f65/gruvi.php#L50) matches the web server's external/public URL)
3. Set the required execution and read/write file permissions (usually the web server user/group and `chmod 755`) on:
   * gruvi.php
   * gruvi.txt, sbradio.txt and sbtouch.txt
   * the ./gruvi_img folder
4. Ensure that the gruvi.php script and web server user/group has read permissions for the image source paths
